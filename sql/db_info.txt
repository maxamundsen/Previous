Database management:

When making any change to the database, the query that carried out the action should be saved for future record.
The convention for this project is to place all of these scripts inside
$PROJECT_ROOT/sql/migrations

All change scripts should be numbered to indicate the order that they are executed.
Executing each script in order should 'migrate' from nothing, to a schema fully compatible with your program.

When creating these scripts, following these guidelines:

FILE NAME: [INDEX]_[*ACTION]_[TABLE].sql
	Examples:
	01_UDPATE_USERID_USERS.sql
	57_REMOVE_IPADDR_SESSIONS.sql
	182_CREATE_TABLE_BOOKS.sql

SCRIPT CONTENT:
	Each script should be idempotent, meaning it can be run more than once without doing any additional changes on subsequent execution.
	This means each script needs to check and ensure that it is in the desired state before making a modification.
	If the database IS in the desired state, the script should fail to avoid accidentally overwriting data.
