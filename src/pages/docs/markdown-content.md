# Views: Markdown Content

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) is a markup language that allows for formatting inside plaintext documemnts.
Markdown content is typical for websites, blogs, and for user-generated content.

There is a wrapper component in the codebase designed for handling Markdown content:

```go
func Markdown(input string) Node
```

This component takes an input string containing valid markdown syntax, and returns a `gomponents.Node` (see [documentation on the component system](/docs/component-system) to understand how this could compose with other components).

Under the hood, the output is a `Raw` component containing the HTML string generated by the Markdown converter.

The documentation that you are reading right now is written in Markdown, and rendered using the above method.

## Styling Markdown Output

Because Markdown outputs a `Raw` Node, you do _not_ have the ability to individually address each HTML element.
However, the output HTML is plain and contains no classes or builtin styling, so styling is fairly straightforward with a simple stylesheet.
Semantic CSS libraries provide great out of the box styling for plain HTML.
If you use TailwindCSS, you can use the `prose` class to automatically style plain HTML.
